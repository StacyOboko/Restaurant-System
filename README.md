# Restaurant-System
Description

The sole purpose of this project is to solve the problem of congestion in restaurants in the sense that if someone goes to a restaurant during a busy day, they may have to either wait too long to get a table or have to go to different restaurants looking for tables. This process of going from restaurant to restaurant is tiring and may result in someone just going home and ordering a take-out instead of eating out. This application makes this process less tiresome and enables its user to know the best days to go to the restaurant as well as book tables and know the food provided by the restaurant as well as available prices and how to reach out to the restaurant incase of inquiries on issues of table-booking.

Functionality

Through the HTML, JS and CSS format, I am able to present the program in an attractive way. The program fetches data such as the menu from the database, the db.son file. The application has four HTML files, the index.html file that shows information on the Home page, the menu.html file that shows the information on the menu, the register.html file that shows information on the registration page and the tablebooking.html file that shows information on the table booking page. The style.css file style the pages to be attractice and the app.js file contols the functionality of the application.

Explanation of Application

The home page has the HOME, MENU and REGISTER buttons. The user first registers themselves into the application by providing their names, email address and phone number. The page then redirects them to the menu page where they can see the menu that has the available food provided by the restaurant, their prices, description and availability. The page still has a HOME,REGISTER and TABLE-BOOKING button. The user then books a table by pressing the table-booking button that directs them to a new page where they can provide their names and suitable time. A message "The table is successfully booked for the next hour" then pops up to the screen. This shows the user has successfully booked the table for the next hour. On the lapse of this time, the application notifies the user with a message "Sorry but the table has expired". The user then has to book another table.
